<title> dotConnect for Oracle – fast, functional, and reliable data provider for software developers</title>

One reputable IT company worked for the client and built a new application on their request. In the process, the team wanted to connect .NET to Oracle used as the application background and ensure accurate mapping of stored procedures. It is not rocket science. Oracle has its native data access. Unfortunately, in that case, the native functionality was not efficient enough. 

The team requires more options and has to search for other solutions to ensure a fast connection of the .NET Framework to Oracle and let the developers do their routines faster and error-free. These days, the most popular technologies for web-based apps built with .NET and grounded on databases like Oracle are ASP.NET and ADO.NET. 

ADO.NET was used in the data connectivity provider that eventually resolved all problems for the team mentioned above – dotConnect for Oracle. However, let us get to some basics first.

What is ADO.NET technology and how it serves in application development

ADO.NET appeared in the .NET Framework version 1.0 as a new method to handle access to different data sources and manipulate data. Now it supports relational, XML, and application data. Also, it supports object-oriented programming and provides all classes and method objects for database-related operations. 

In practice, developers mostly use it to grant the connection between the .NET-based applications and the database applications, passing the data between them bilaterally. Data access is possible for all types of databases, in both connected (with the data source open) and disconnected (without open connection) modes.  

The popularity of ADO.NET grew high because of its undoubtedly helpful features: 

High Scalability – due to the possibility of accessing data in a disconnected mode resources aren't wasted, and multiple users can access the data simultaneously and efficiently. 

Programmability – it lets you use the Microsoft Visual Studio capacities including IntelliSense to make the coding routines smooth and easy. 

Maintainability – the architecture of ADO.NET is multilayered. Developers can build the software logic in a separate layer, adding new features faster and with fewer risks. 

Interoperability – this technology uses the XML data format when transferring data between the source/database and the application. 

Performance – classes allow the developers to maintain a high level of performance in both connected and disconnected modes.

Classes ensure the connection to the data source with either read-only access or letting manipulation of the data. Classes execute commands against those sources, modify the data into work units, define parameters for statements (including stored procedures), and store all those parameters. Other classes allow for retrieving and updating the data in the source and working with the data in memory. 

These advantages of ADO.NET conditioned its usage in the dotConnect family developed by the Devart company. 

dotConnect – the data connectivity product line for database apps 

dotConnect for Oracle was the beginning of the popular product line in Devart which now includes dedicated data connectivity solutions for all popular databases and cloud solutions. ADO.NET is their background, and dotConnect providers implemented it into the processes and added more functionality for software developers. 

What makes these solutions so helpful? 

Database-specific features – each dedicated dotConnect provider is adjusted to specific features of each data source. 

ORM Support – includes such technologies as Entity Framework and NHibernate along with LinqConnect (the Devart’s own ORM solution similar to LINQ to SQL, but with enhanced functionality). The visual designer Entity Developer lets you create ORM models much faster.  

Visual Studio Integration – dotConnect solutions integrate flawlessly with design-time features, so you can use their functionality while developing applications in Visual Studio. 

Microsoft Technology Support – these data providers suit perfectly if you work with many Microsoft data-oriented technologies, such as Microsoft Sync Framework, Microsoft Enterprise Library Data Access Application Block, etc. 

RAD Approach – you can configure and work with the data access layer on the fly. Visual tools, such as component editors, let you work much more productively.

SQL Execution Monitoring – a separate dbMonitor traces the performance of all applications and Windows services and detects any kinds of failures. 

Demo Projects – help you master the dotConnect providers quickly in practice with all the classes and other technologies used. 

The company provides full detailed documentation for each provider and a professional support team to handle all users' questions and help them with any issues should they arise. 

Modern dotConnect data connectivity providers are the most advanced solutions in this area, the result of 17 years of development and improvement. dotConnect for Oracle was the first among them, and it remains the leader of this product line

dotConnect for Oracle – what it brings and how it helps

Oracle is the most popular database management system in the world. It is the background of countless applications. And though there is the system Oracle Client, it often does not satisfy the developers' needs, as it happened with the team mentioned at the beginning of this article. Here, dotConnect for Oracle can be that deciding factor in letting the team achieve success. 

dotConnect for Oracle is the database connectivity provider developed on the ADO.NET technology and adjusted to resolve the Oracle connection, data access, and data handling tasks. Like the other dotConnect providers for databases, it equips the users with the default Entity Framework and LINQ to SQL support features. Also, it offers plenty of original features making application development much more productive with its optimized code and algorithms for data access.

First and foremost, dotConnect for Oracle is 100% adjusted to work with Oracle’s specificity. It supports Advanced Queuing, Transparent Application Failover, Direct Path Loading, Oracle Transaction Guard, Change notifications, Alerts, Pipes, Connection pool performance counters, REF cursors, objects, packages, etc. Developers get access to all Oracle benefits and can exploit all the Oracle functionality in applications. 

Besides, dotConnect for Oracle provides direct access to this data source. You don't need to use Oracle's own Client, neither you need any additional libraries or clients. The installation package of this data connectivity solution includes everything you need. Based on ADO.NET, it supports all new ADO.NET features as soon as they are available. 

This tool is compatible completely with the following frameworks: 

.NET Frameworks 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, .NET 5, .NET 6 and .NET Compact Framework. Also, it supports 
Mono version 2.0 and higher.
