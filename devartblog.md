<h1> dotConnect for Oracle – fast, functional, and reliable data provider for software developers</h1>

<p>One reputable IT company worked for the client and built a new application on their request. In the process, the team wanted to connect .NET to Oracle used as the application background and ensure accurate mapping of stored procedures. It is not rocket science. Oracle has its native data access. Unfortunately, in that case, the native functionality was not efficient enough.</p>

<p>The team requires more options and has to search for other solutions to ensure a fast connection of the .NET Framework to Oracle and let the developers do their routines faster and error-free. These days, the most popular technologies for web-based apps built with .NET and grounded on databases like Oracle are ASP.NET and ADO.NET. </p>

<p>ADO.NET was used in the data connectivity provider that eventually resolved all problems for the team mentioned above – dotConnect for Oracle. However, let us get to some basics first.</p>

<h1>What is ADO.NET technology and how it serves in application development</h1>

<p>ADO.NET appeared in the .NET Framework version 1.0 as a new method to handle access to different data sources and manipulate data. Now it supports relational, XML, and application data. Also, it supports object-oriented programming and provides all classes and method objects for database-related operations. </p>

<p>In practice, developers mostly use it to grant the connection between the .NET-based applications and the database applications, passing the data between them bilaterally. Data access is possible for all types of databases, in both connected (with the data source open) and disconnected (without open connection) modes.  </p>

<p>The popularity of ADO.NET grew high because of its undoubtedly helpful features: </p>
<ul>
<li>High Scalability – due to the possibility of accessing data in a disconnected mode resources aren't wasted, and multiple users can access the data simultaneously and efficiently. </li>

<li>Programmability – it lets you use the Microsoft Visual Studio capacities including IntelliSense to make the coding routines smooth and easy. </li>

<li>Maintainability – the architecture of ADO.NET is multilayered. Developers can build the software logic in a separate layer, adding new features faster and with fewer risks. </li>

<li>Interoperability – this technology uses the XML data format when transferring data between the source/database and the application. </li>

<li>Performance – classes allow the developers to maintain a high level of performance in both connected and disconnected modes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Classes ensure the connection to the data source with either read-only access or letting manipulation of the data. Classes execute commands against those sources, modify the data into work units, define parameters for statements (including stored procedures), and store all those parameters. Other classes allow for retrieving and updating the data in the source and working with the data in memory. </p>

<p>These advantages of ADO.NET conditioned its usage in the dotConnect family developed by the Devart company. </p>
